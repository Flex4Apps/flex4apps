# How to contribute

We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project progress.

## Testing

At the moment there are not specific testing requirements other than you running your code on a newly setup machine.


## Submitting changes

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please  make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,

The Flex4Apps team
