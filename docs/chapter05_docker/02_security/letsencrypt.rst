Let's encrypt
=============

Let's Encrypt (German "Lasst uns verschl√ºsseln") is a certification authority that went into operation at the end of 2015 and offers free X.509 certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS). An automated process replaces the previously common complex manual procedures for the creation, validation, signing, setup and renewal of certificates for encrypted websites.
