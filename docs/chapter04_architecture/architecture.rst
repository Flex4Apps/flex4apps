The Flex4Apps framework consists of several components that are described in the following section.  For the sake of clarity, however, it is worth dividing it into two main components:
a) the Cyber-Physical-Systems - hardware, paired with software, which stands locally. This can range from a simple temperature sensor to a highly complex network communication device.
b) The Cloud System - a software solution that receives, processes, stores and displays data collected by Cyber-Physical Systems.
