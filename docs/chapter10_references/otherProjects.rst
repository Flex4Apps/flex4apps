**SCRATCh** - SeCuRe and Agile Connected Things (`website <https://itea3.org/project/scratch.html>`_)

About scratch: The development and operation of secure, large-scale IoT systems is difficult. Technological platforms providing the necessary building blocks to integrate devices and backbone logic exist, but do not address the major concerns of today's software-intensive systems: security, agility and a need for continuous deployment. SCRATCh proposes an integrative approach to IoT, security and DevOps practices through an architectural and process platform consisting of a hardware security foundation for device identity management and security metrics collection, DevOps IoT platform and DevSecOps process, promoting continuous secure operation.
