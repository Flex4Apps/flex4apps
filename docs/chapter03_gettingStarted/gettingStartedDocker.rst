... using Docker Swarm
####################################

you can start working with your own Docker Swarm quite quickly. Either execute the line below, or if you are sceptical about what the script does (and you usually should!):

* download the script manually and evaluate it for security risks
* then execute it if you feel comfortable or
* repeat the steps manually as they are documented in the script.

If the execution of the script fails - you might either have to specify your network interface or provide the public IP manually.



.. code-block:: bash

    wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flex4Apps/flex4apps/master/src/docker/setupBareMetal.sh | bash
