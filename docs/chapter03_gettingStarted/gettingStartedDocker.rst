... using Docker Swarm
####################################

you can start working with your own Docker Swarm quite quickly. Either execute the line below, or if you are sceptical about what the script does (and you usually should!):

* download the script manually and evaluate it for securiy risks
* then execute it if you feel comfortable or
* repeat the steps manually as they are documented in the script.



.. code-block:: bash

    wget -O - https://github.com/Flex4Apps/flex4apps/blob/master/src/docker/setupBareMetal.sh | bash
